# Learner List - React App

This is a simple React app that displays a list of learners, their bios, and their scores. The app dynamically renders components based on provided data.

## Features
- Uses React state to manage learner data.
- Dynamically renders learners and their scores.
- Organized into modular components (`App`, `Learner`, and `Score`).
- Basic styling support via `App.css`.

## How It Works
### App.jsx:
Stores the list of learners in state.
Loops through learners and renders <Learner> components.

### Learner.jsx:
Displays the name and bio of each learner.
Loops through their scores and renders <Score> components.

### Score.jsx:
Displays each scoreâ€™s date and value.
